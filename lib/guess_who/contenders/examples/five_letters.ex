defmodule GuessWho.Contenders.Examples.FiveLetters do
  @moduledoc """
    This is sample contender Five Letters, another ever so slightly more intelligent
    example contender.

    It asks whether or not the character has 5 or more letters in their name.

    If the character has five or more letters (15 out of 24 characters):
    Worst performance: 1 (determination of five or more letters) + 15 (number of characters with five or more letters) = 16 guesses
    Median performance: 1 (determination of five or more letters) + 8 (median number of characters with five or more letters) = 9 guesses

    If the character has fewer than five letters (9 out of 24 characters):
    Worst performance: 1 (determination of fewer than five letters) + 9 (number of characters with fewer than five letters) = 16 guesses
    Median performance: 1 (determination of fewer than five letters) + 5 (median number of characters with fewer than five letters) = 6 guesses

    Overall:
    Worst performance: 16 guesses
    Median performance: 15/24 * 9 + 9/24 * 6 = 7.875
